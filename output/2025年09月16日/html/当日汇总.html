While not holding an official title, Ma has been instrumental in the decision to &lt;b&gt;spend as much as 50 billion yuan ($7 billion) on subsidies to counter JD.com’s market push&lt;/b&gt;. “Retirement doesn’t mean I’ve left Alibaba. If Alibaba calls me, I’ll always be there,” Ma previously told state media. As of July, Alibaba held 43% of China’s food delivery market, just behind Meituan’s 47%, according to Goldman Sachs, though Ma’s aggressive push risks renewed government ire over “malicious subsidies.” Internally, his return has boosted morale but complicated the reporting structure, as some employees now view him as the top decision maker. Despite being unlikely to return officially, Ma wears a company badge on campus, signaling to staff that he’s “back in action.”</a>

The two sides talked for &lt;b&gt;six hours&lt;/b&gt; or so on Monday after going late into the night the previous day. There were no major developments in trade discussions, however, with &lt;b&gt;Greer saying talks on “those kinds of things” had been “deferred” to another time&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;US &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;President Donald Trump said he would speak with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Friday&lt;/b&gt;. He hinted that he’ll pursue a wider trade accord in contacts with Xi. Trump said his top concern was “frankly, more importantly, a big deal.” &lt;br/&gt;- US Treasury Secretary &lt;b&gt;Scott Bessent&lt;/b&gt; told reporters that a framework to keep ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok app running in the US had been reached.​ “I think the framework is for it to switch to US-controlled ownership.” Bessent told reporters Monday, “&lt;b&gt;We will be holding trade negotiations in about a month, again at a different location&lt;/b&gt;.” The Treasury chief said it “remains to be seen” whether a trade deal can be done with China before the APEC summit. Bessent said a September 17 deadline that could have disrupted the popular social media app in the U.S. encouraged Chinese negotiators to reach a potential deal. He said that &lt;b&gt;deadline could be extended by 90 days to allow the deal to be finalized&lt;/b&gt;, but declined to discuss specifics of the deal. Bessent said when commercial terms of the deal are revealed, it will preserve cultural aspects of TikTok that Chinese negotiators care about.&lt;br/&gt;- US Trade Representative &lt;b&gt;Jamieson Greer&lt;/b&gt; indicated that another extension in the pause on the highest tariff levels is possible when the November deadline arrives.&lt;br/&gt;- The Madrid talks were focused on TikTok, with negotiations on other topics essentially deferred, Bessent and Greer indicated.&lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;A White House official&lt;/b&gt; said if the leaders of both nations agree, &lt;b&gt;the terms would be similar to a proposal the U.S. reviewed in April&lt;/b&gt;. Under that proposal, a consortium of investors would take an ownership stake in TikTok. &lt;b&gt;Private-equity firm Blackstone&lt;/b&gt;, which was previously a contender to be part of the consortium, &lt;b&gt;is no longer part of the potential deal, according to people familiar with the matter.&lt;/b&gt; The White House created an official TikTok account last month. Trump’s attempt to save the platform is a reversal from his first term, when he sought to ban it, then blessed a tentative agreement to save it in which Oracle and Walmart would have invested. The deal never went through. Co-founded by Republican megadonor Larry Ellison, the world’s second-richest person, &lt;b&gt;Oracle &lt;/b&gt;hosts TikTok user data and is expected to be involved in the new agreement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;China&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- China’s Vice Commerce Minister Li Chenggang told reporters in Madrid that a framework of “consensus” had been reached on TikTok, while cautioning that Beijing won’t sacrifice principles for a deal. China opposes the politicization and weaponization of technology and trade matters and will safeguard its national interests and the rights and interests of its companies, Li said.&lt;br/&gt;- Wang Jingtao, a deputy director of China’s Cyberspace Administration, referred to methods such as the entrusted operation of TikTok’s US user data, and mentioned algorithms and intellectual property rights, without getting into specifics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ahead of the Talk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Last week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth spoke with their Chinese counterparts. Had there been no deal on TikTok, a Trump-Xi meeting on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation gathering in South Korea late next month would have been off the table, the official said.&lt;br/&gt;- Ahead of the talks on Sunday, China launched two investigations targeting the US semiconductor industry.&lt;br/&gt;- On Monday, China’s market regulator said that a preliminary investigation found Nvidia was in violation of the country’s anti-competition laws, adding that a further probe into the U.S. chip giant will be carried out.</a>

While not holding an official title, Ma has been instrumental in the decision to &lt;b&gt;spend as much as 50 billion yuan ($7 billion) on subsidies to counter JD.com’s market push&lt;/b&gt;. “Retirement doesn’t mean I’ve left Alibaba. If Alibaba calls me, I’ll always be there,” Ma previously told state media. As of July, Alibaba held 43% of China’s food delivery market, just behind Meituan’s 47%, according to Goldman Sachs, though Ma’s aggressive push risks renewed government ire over “malicious subsidies.” Internally, his return has boosted morale but complicated the reporting structure, as some employees now view him as the top decision maker. Despite being unlikely to return officially, Ma wears a company badge on campus, signaling to staff that he’s “back in action.”</a>

The two sides talked for &lt;b&gt;six hours&lt;/b&gt; or so on Monday after going late into the night the previous day. There were no major developments in trade discussions, however, with &lt;b&gt;Greer saying talks on “those kinds of things” had been “deferred” to another time&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;US &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;President Donald Trump said he would speak with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Friday&lt;/b&gt;. He hinted that he’ll pursue a wider trade accord in contacts with Xi. Trump said his top concern was “frankly, more importantly, a big deal.” &lt;br/&gt;- US Treasury Secretary &lt;b&gt;Scott Bessent&lt;/b&gt; told reporters that a framework to keep ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok app running in the US had been reached.​ “I think the framework is for it to switch to US-controlled ownership.” Bessent told reporters Monday, “&lt;b&gt;We will be holding trade negotiations in about a month, again at a different location&lt;/b&gt;.” The Treasury chief said it “remains to be seen” whether a trade deal can be done with China before the APEC summit. Bessent said a September 17 deadline that could have disrupted the popular social media app in the U.S. encouraged Chinese negotiators to reach a potential deal. He said that &lt;b&gt;deadline could be extended by 90 days to allow the deal to be finalized&lt;/b&gt;, but declined to discuss specifics of the deal. Bessent said when commercial terms of the deal are revealed, it will preserve cultural aspects of TikTok that Chinese negotiators care about.&lt;br/&gt;- US Trade Representative &lt;b&gt;Jamieson Greer&lt;/b&gt; indicated that another extension in the pause on the highest tariff levels is possible when the November deadline arrives.&lt;br/&gt;- The Madrid talks were focused on TikTok, with negotiations on other topics essentially deferred, Bessent and Greer indicated.&lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;A White House official&lt;/b&gt; said if the leaders of both nations agree, &lt;b&gt;the terms would be similar to a proposal the U.S. reviewed in April&lt;/b&gt;. Under that proposal, a consortium of investors would take an ownership stake in TikTok. &lt;b&gt;Private-equity firm Blackstone&lt;/b&gt;, which was previously a contender to be part of the consortium, &lt;b&gt;is no longer part of the potential deal, according to people familiar with the matter.&lt;/b&gt; The White House created an official TikTok account last month. Trump’s attempt to save the platform is a reversal from his first term, when he sought to ban it, then blessed a tentative agreement to save it in which Oracle and Walmart would have invested. The deal never went through. Co-founded by Republican megadonor Larry Ellison, the world’s second-richest person, &lt;b&gt;Oracle &lt;/b&gt;hosts TikTok user data and is expected to be involved in the new agreement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;China&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- China’s Vice Commerce Minister Li Chenggang told reporters in Madrid that a framework of “consensus” had been reached on TikTok, while cautioning that Beijing won’t sacrifice principles for a deal. China opposes the politicization and weaponization of technology and trade matters and will safeguard its national interests and the rights and interests of its companies, Li said.&lt;br/&gt;- Wang Jingtao, a deputy director of China’s Cyberspace Administration, referred to methods such as the entrusted operation of TikTok’s US user data, and mentioned algorithms and intellectual property rights, without getting into specifics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ahead of the Talk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Last week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth spoke with their Chinese counterparts. Had there been no deal on TikTok, a Trump-Xi meeting on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation gathering in South Korea late next month would have been off the table, the official said.&lt;br/&gt;- Ahead of the talks on Sunday, China launched two investigations targeting the US semiconductor industry.&lt;br/&gt;- On Monday, China’s market regulator said that a preliminary investigation found Nvidia was in violation of the country’s anti-competition laws, adding that a further probe into the U.S. chip giant will be carried out.</a>
